# FIR Filter Design

## by &nbsp; <img src="README_resources/AmarRed.png" alt="signature" width="50"/>

## Intro
This repository gives a walk through on the complete design process of a multi-tap low-pass FIR filter on an FPGA. Moving forward, the "multi-tap low-pass FIR filter" will be refered to as "filter." This report is divided into five sections:

0. [Necessary software and setup](#necessary-software-and-setup)
1. [Filter Coefficient and Frequency Design](#filter-coefficient-and-frequency-design)
2. [Filter Architecture Design](#filter-architecture-design)
    * Pipelined FIR
    * L2 Parallel FIR
    * L3 Parallel FIR
    * Pipelined, L3 Parallel FIR
3. [Filter Implementation and Testing](#filter-implementation-and-testing)
    * For each filter, performance, power, criticla path timing, and space/resource usage on FPGA will be analyzed
4. Comparison of all filters

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not know what an FIR filter is or the principles of pipelining and paralelization in DSP design, I would recommend touching up on that first. Some links are provided in the [Resources](#resources) section.
